			<br>
			<u>V2.0.4 - 11/20/2020</u><br>

			<br>
			<u>V2.0.3 - 11/18/2020</u><br>
			Added dynamic height for objective window (NOTE: This could cause potential issues with heights in vertical modes with several objectives)<br>

			Re-ordered the objectives in the selection menu to be alphabetical, to make things easier to find, instead of the default sorting.<br>
			<br>
			<u>V2.0.0 - 7/11/2020</u><br>
			The site and tracker have been redesigned! We updated the overall look of the site, added some new features, and most importantly, added a new objective tracker for easier tracking of objectives! We did remove a couple of relatively unused features, like the flags tracker. We may put those back in at a later date, but they were sacrified for space.<br>
			Please report any issues that you may find, thank you!<br>
			<br>
			<u>V1.9.4 - 7/6/2020</u><br>
			Updated flags parser for 4.1.0 flags and new objective options.<br>
			<br>
			<u>V1.9.3 - 1/17/2020</u><br>
			Added search to the Objective list to make it easier to locate objectives on the large list.<br>
			<br>
			<u>V1.9.2 - 1/5/2020</u><br>
			Fixed remaining outstanding flag set options, so they should be showing up properly and available on the flag summary list.<br>
			<br>
			<u>V1.9.1 - 1/3/2020</u><br>
			Added custom objective tracking! I will be modifying this in the near future to allow for easier searching. Also includes Dark Matter tracking if that mode is live.<br>
			Added most (but not all) of the flag lists. There are a few flags that do not show up correctly, I have to adjust the structure as it changed in the official 4.0 release, so it will be out Soon (tm).<br>
			<br>
			<u>V1.9.0 - 11/25/2019</u><br>
			Updated flag parser for the new v4.0.0 flags!<br>
			 - Just a note, I haven't been keeping up with all of the v4.0.0 changes, so I hope I got everything right, but please report any issues to Dunka (Discord: BigDunka#8354) and I will get them updated! Other new features, like the Dark Matter hunt and custom objectives, will be added in the near future!<br>
			<br>

			Updated text for Sheila's locations, as she has all the goods<br>
			<br>
			<u>V1.7.4 - 7/15/2019</u><br>
			Removed placeholders for Armory, Bestiary, and Character data sheets<br>
			 - To explain this removal, since those placeholders were put up, two of the three features were recently added into easily accessible data, or even included within the game rom itself, thus making their use obsolete. Only the bestiary is not easily available. For this data, b0ardface posted it publicly and you can access it <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hJZsbzStQfMCQUFzjW9pbdLhJ99wLu1QY-5cmp7Peqg/edit#gid=721989275" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>

			Fixed logic to not include hook route when location tracking is disabled<br>
			Various typos fixed<br>
			<br>			
			<u>V1.7.2 - 3/17/2019</u><br>
			Added character tracking hide flag for those that only want the item and location tracker<br>
			JS fix referencing invalid object<br>
			Added delay to new mouse hover text so it doesn't fire immediately upon hover<br>
			<br>			
			<u>V1.7.1 - 2/27/2019</u><br>
			Minor text changes and typos<br>
			Modified required item reminders to simplify when parent key items or duplicate goals are reached [Pass always gets priority over Darkness Crystal]<br>

			<br>
